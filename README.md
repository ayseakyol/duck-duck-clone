# Project of DuckDuckClone

## Description
I prepared this project to build my own accessible & responsive clone of the DuckDuckGo home page with using **HTML5, CSS3**. To do accessible and responsive I used `bootstrap`. 

## Visual
This is the main page of the project:

## Installation
With the `Visual Studio Code` I prepared this project. 

## Features
Especially using `bootstrap` codes are very helpful to prepare more responsive and accessible web page. `Bootstrap` builds responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the worldâ€™s most popular front-end component library.  


## Usage
With the help of **search form and different slides** people can understand the aim of page and search privately what they want. Also navbar is very helpful to get around the pages. 

## Inspiration
Thanks to `DuckDuckGo` for the inspiration of the page. 

## Project status
I finished the project with using 8 branches and master branch.
